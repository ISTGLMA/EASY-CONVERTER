It's currently in **Alpha** so do expect stuff to break, bug out or just simply not work at all.

# How it works
Just open **EASY-CONVERTER**, drag a file you want to convert inside of the UX and you'll notice it pastes the **PATH** of the file, then you just press **ENTER** and it'll list alternate filetypes that you can convert your file to.

# Is it safe?
Yes as with anything I release, it is **100%** safe. If someone is asking you to download or even buy it from them or any external source, don't as you are likely being scammed or redirected to something potentially harmful. **Please only download from this page!**

# Why isn’t the Source Code available?  
To protect sensitive information within the program, the source code for **EASY-CONVERTER** is not publicly available. This does **NOT** mean the tool is unsafe or untrustworthy—it’s simply a precaution to safeguard the embedded data.

# Do I need to use EASY-CONVERTER?
No, you don't have to use **EASY-CONVERTER** by any means. It's just an alternative to the sketchy websites that like to redirect you, collect data and invade your privacy. This also happens with bloated software alternatives, including GUI ones. 

If you want to be left alone when converting files, **EASY-CONVERTER** is that alternative.

# Credits
This tool wouldn't of been possible without **FFMPEG** by **Fabrice Bellard**. It relies on it as a backend and **EASY-CONVERTER** does the heavy lifting for you. If you'd like to use **FFMPEG** as it is, you can download it [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
